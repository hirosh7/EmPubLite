<h1>About</h1>
<p>SafeSpeak is a smartphone safety application which provides hands free engagement.
    While all other safety applications require the user to touch their device to bring up the safety
    application, this one does not.  The application is ready at all times and 'listening' for a user
    defined 'safe' word in order to inform the preset contacts.</p>
